      Far Cry Primal is an action-adventure game set in an open world environment and played from a first-person perspective. As the game is set in prehistoric times, the traditional gunplay and vehicle gameplay featured in the Far Cry series were removed,[1] and players can only get access to melee weapons like spears, clubs, axes, and ranged weapons like bows and slings.[2] Players cannot purchase weapons, and must craft them using the materials scavenged in the world such as wood and stone. As players progress, they can craft more lethal weapons with a larger variety of resources. Besides facing natural predators, players must also compete with other hostile tribes occupying the area. By attacking and seizing bonfires and camps, the Wenja tribe will move in and begin patrolling the nearby region, and the player will gain fast travel points as well as camps to rest in. Non-player characters (NPCs) will also task the player to rescue tribe-mates and perform other tasks which improve the village, as well as provide free crafting materials. The game also features a day-night cycle, which affects the gameplay.[3] At night, more predators are present, and many become more aggressive and dangerous, whereas at the day, players can gather food and scavenge other resources such as tools for hunting. Players can also make use of fire as a tool for personal protection or hunting at night.[2][4]
