      Just Cause 3 is an action-adventure video game developed by Avalanche Studios and published by Square Enix. Announced on November 11, 2014, it is the third game in the Just Cause series and the sequel to 2010's Just Cause 2. It was released worldwide on December 1, 2015 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

Set six years after its predecessor, Just Cause 3 follows series protagonist Rico Rodriguez as he returns to his birthplace of Medici, a fictional Mediterranean republic under the brutal control of dictator General Sebastiano Di Ravello. The game is played from a third-person view and allows players to explore the island of Medici in an open-ended environment.

Just Cause 3 received generally positive reviews; critics praised the open-ended gameplay, the game's destruction mechanics and promotion of player agency, while criticism was directed at the game's narrative, which some considered clich√©d and uninspired, and performance issues, particularly on the console versions of the game.
