      Battlefield series games usually focus on large, online multiplayer battles (with the exception of Battlefield Hardline). Playing in squads has become a major element of games in the series.

Since Battlefield 2, the series centrally record online stats for each player allowing the players to receive rank promotions and weapon unlocks based on their stats as well as awards such as medals, ribbons and pins.

A class system has been present within all the Battlefield games. Each class features a different type of primary weapon along with different equipment, differentiating roles on the battlefield.

The ability to engage other players in mêlée combat with a knife has been present in Battlefield games. Since Battlefield 2142, the series has included an award of dog tags for each player killed using a knife
