    Call of Duty: WWII is an upcoming first-person shooter video game developed by Sledgehammer Games, and published by Activision for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Microsoft Windows. It is the fourtheenth primary installment and first Call of Duty series game to be set primarily during World War II since Call of Duty: World at War in 2008.[1] The game was announced on April 21, 2017, with a reveal trailer released on April 26, 2017. The game is set to be released worldwide on November 3, 2017

    Gameplay-wise, WWII is the first title since the original Call of Duty to not feature health regeneration in the campaign. Instead, players must rely on their medic squadmates to provide health packs, as well as other squad members to provide ammunition. In addition to the lack of resources in Campaign, all players are in "Hardcore Mode" automatically, eliminating the campaign's difficulty settings. In May 2017, developer Michael Condrey confirmed on Twitter that the game will not feature the unlimited sprint mechanic seen in the previous two Call of Duty titles.

    A multiplayer reveal for Call of Duty: WWII is planned for E3 2017, which will take place from June 13â€“15.[6] Sledgehammer Games has announced new features such as the new headquarters social space, divisions, war mode and the return to "boots-on-the-ground" gameplay. This refers to recent Call of Duty games that featured elements such as double-jumping, jet-packing, and wall-running. There will be a new class based progression system. Players who pre-order the game will be invited to a closed beta, which will initially be for the PlayStation 4, but later be released on other platforms.
